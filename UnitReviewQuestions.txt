# Description: Each week, we are supposed to start the week off by asking 
			   questions


Week 1
	-Why does the \n line break string function go inside the double quotes and
     not outside them?
		-it indicates that you want an empty line below it. And it won't work 
		 outside the quotes.
	-Is there a way to print something on the same line as the previous print command?
		-Yes, but not with what we learned.
	-Are empty lines ignored in python?
		-Yes
Week 2
	-Why are right-most ** (exponential) operations performed first?
		They have to be for math to work right
	-Why are there multiple ways to do some math operations?

Week 3
	-Can python functions only handle 1 return variable?
		-It can handle more, we just haven't covered that, and it's generally
		 better to only return one variable.
	-Why does main both need to exist and be called?
		-Main exists to:
		a) keep the file clean and readable
		b) show examples of how code is used when the file is used as a module.
		c) be ignored when the file's code is being used as a module
	-What does sep=' ' mean at the end of the replit snippet in getting ready?
		-sep is a way of telling python what character to put between separate
		 segments of a print line.
