# Description: Each week, we are supposed to start the week off by asking 
			   questions


Week 1
	-Why does the \n line break string function go inside the double quotes and
     not outside them?
		-it indicates that you want an empty line below it. And it won't work 
		 outside the quotes.
	-Is there a way to print something on the same line as the previous print command?
		-Yes, but not with what we learned.
	-Are empty lines ignored in python?
		-Yes
Week 2
	-Why are right-most ** (exponential) operations performed first?
		They have to be for math to work right
	-Why are there multiple ways to do some math operations?

Week 3
	-Can python functions only handle 1 return variable?
		-It can handle more, we just haven't covered that, and it's generally
		 better to only return one variable.
	-Why does main both need to exist and be called?
		-Main exists to:
		a) keep the file clean and readable
		b) show examples of how code is used when the file is used as a module.
		c) be ignored when the file's code is being used as a module
	-What does sep=' ' mean at the end of the replit snippet in getting ready?
		-sep is a way of telling python what character to put between separate
		 segments of a print line.

Week 4
	-Why does elif exist if it's just a shortened else-if statement?
		-Brevity and ease of writing code
	-Why are we not learning about input sanitization yet?
		-Because checking inputs for anything beyond strings matching is
		complicated.
	-Why are variables initialized at the beginning of a function if Python
	 works just fine if they're not?
		-It's good practice, as other languages do not work like this. It also 
		 allows for better debugging as you do not have to worry about the
		 type getting misintepreted somewhere due to sloppy code or user error.

Week 5
    -What does __name__ do?
        -
    -What is the difference between a for and while loop?
        -A for loop iterates its code until a bound is reached, where the code
         increments that bound each time. A while loop simple loops the code
         until some condition is reached.
    -Other languages have the ability to specify how much an accumulator
     variable moves during the definition of a for loop. Why not in python?
        -It does, just not in the way you're used to.
         whereas in c++ it's something like:
            for (int i = 0, i < 10, ++1)
         where the iterative variable, its range and its incrementation are
         all defined on the same line, for loops in python use the range
         function instead to define the range and the ++ function works
         differently.
