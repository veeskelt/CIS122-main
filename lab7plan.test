-Greeting
-Get input from user:

"Please enter the total session run time's hours: "
    -This only accepts ints (v.get_int)
    -Store it in run_time_hrs.append()
"Please enter the total session's run time in minutes: "
    -This also only accepts ints
    -Store it in run_time_mins.append()
    -Before this is returned, divide the input by 60 to get a decimal value
"Do you have another run time to enter? (y/n)
    -standard "while cont == y" loop
    -Loops the user input functions

Once the user is done entering total run times, run the calcs
    -Convert the run_time_hrs and run_time_mins to run_time_full:
        for i in range(len(run_time_hrs)):
            total_time = run_time_hrs[i] + run_time_mins[i]
            run_time_full.append(total_time)
    -Now perform math to find session times (differences between total session times)
        for i in range (len(run_time_hrs)):
            if i == 1:
                sesh_time = run_time_full[i]
                sesh_list.append(sesh_time)
            else:
                sesh_time = run_time_full[i] - run_time_full[i-1]
                sesh_list.append(sesh_time)
